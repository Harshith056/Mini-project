1. Project Statement:
The updated goal is to create a basic calculator application in C that can perform simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on n numbers. The application should allow users to input a specified number of operands and select an operation to perform.
2. Proposed Solution
The solution involves:
Allowing the user to specify how many numbers they want to operate on.
Storing the numbers in an array.
Performing the selected operation on all the numbers in the array.
Displaying the result of the operation.
Code Description
Function Prototypes: The prototypes for the arithmetic operations are declared at the beginning.
Main Function:
A loop presents a menu to the user until they choose to exit.
The user is prompted to enter the number of operands they want to use.
The program then collects the specified number of inputs into an array.
Based on the user's choice, the corresponding function is called to perform the calculation.
Arithmetic Functions:
Add: Computes and prints the sum of all numbers in the array.
Subtract: Computes and prints the result of subtracting all subsequent numbers from the first.
Multiply: Computes and prints the product of all numbers in the array.
Divide: Checks for division by zero and computes the quotient of the first number divided by.
